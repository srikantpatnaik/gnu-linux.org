Have you ever felt that your favourite song has noise in the background,
or you downloaded an old song which in turn recorded from a old cassette
player resulting in annoying background noise.

To remove such constant noise from your songs or recordings we have a
great cross platform tool called `Audacity`.

**Steps to follow:**

1. Install 'Audacity' from package manager.Go to file->open and select
the audio file.

2. File will be imported and will be shown in a timeline.Play the song
and choose the region where noise appears.

text select tool (just below the zoom tool) to select the region you
find noise.

to remove noise.
